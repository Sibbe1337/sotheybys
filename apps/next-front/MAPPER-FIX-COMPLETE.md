# ✅ MAPPER FIXES APPLIED - DATA QUALITY IMPROVEMENT

**Date:** October 30, 2025  
**Goal:** Extract ALL available fields from Linear API to improve data quality from 49.3% → 100%  

---

## 🎯 PROBLEM IDENTIFIED

The data quality report showed **49.3% completeness**, but the user confirmed that **ALL data is already in Linear**!

The issue was **NOT missing data** - it was **incomplete field extraction** in our mapper.

---

## 🔧 FIXES APPLIED

### **1. Plot Ownership (siteOwnershipType) - FIXED ✅**

**Before:**
```typescript
plotOwnership: lv((src as any).siteOwnershipType),
```

**After:**
```typescript
plotOwnership: lv((src as any).siteOwnershipType ?? (src as any).lotOwnership),
```

**Why:** Linear API uses `lotOwnership` in the response, but we were only looking for `siteOwnershipType`.

---

### **2. Available From (availableFrom) - FIXED ✅**

**Before:**
```typescript
availableFrom: lv((src as any).availableFrom),
```

**After:**
```typescript
availableFrom: lv((src as any).availableFrom ?? (src as any).release ?? (src as any).freeOnText),
```

**Why:** Linear API can use `release` or `freeOnText` fields for availability information.

---

### **3. Year Built (completeYear) - FIXED ✅**

**Before:**
```typescript
yearBuilt: Number(nv.yearBuilt ?? (src as any).yearBuilt) || undefined,
```

**After:**
```typescript
yearBuilt: Number(
  nv.yearBuilt ?? 
  nv.completeYear ?? 
  (src as any).yearBuilt ?? 
  (src as any).completeYear ?? 
  lget((src as any).completeYear!, 'fi')
) || undefined,
```

**Why:** Linear API uses `completeYear` field which wasn't being checked.

---

## 📊 EXPECTED RESULTS

### **Before Fixes:**
```
Overall Average: 49.3%
Properties needing attention: 8/8

Missing fields per property:
- Bernhardinkatu 1: 7 missing (58.8%)
- Heikkiläntie 1: 5 missing (70.6%)
- Kauppiaankatu 8-10: 5 missing (70.6%)
- Albertinkatu 19: 6 missing (64.7%)
```

### **After Fixes (Expected):**
```
Overall Average: 85-95%+ (estimated)
Properties at 100%: 4-6 (estimated)

Fixed fields:
✅ siteOwnershipType (lotOwnership) - extracted correctly
✅ availableFrom (release/freeOnText) - extracted correctly
✅ completeYear - extracted correctly
```

## 🧪 VERIFICATION STEPS

### **Step 1: Wait for API to Recover**
Currently getting HTTP 502 (Bad Gateway) - temporary server issue.

### **Step 2: Run Blueprint Validation**
```bash
cd /Users/emilsoujeh/sothebys/apps/next-front

LINEAR_API_KEY="LINEAR-API-KEY 18f312cd-842f-4762-98b2-e5f64f8009a3" \
COMPANY_ID="180" \
npm run data-quality:blueprint
```

### **Step 3: Check Improvement**
Look for:
- Overall average score increase
- Number of properties at 100%
- Reduced missing field counts

### **Step 4: Test on Website**
```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to properties and verify all fields display correctly.

## 📋 REMAINING FIELDS TO CHECK

If score is still not 100%, check these field mappings:

### **Already Mapped (Should Work):**
- ✅ `fundingCharge` - Line 157
- ✅ `housingCooperativeMortgage` - Line 194
- ✅ `housingTenure` - Line 316
- ✅ `zoningStatus` - Line 325
- ✅ `hasBalcony` - Line 177
- ✅ `sauna` - Line 179
- ✅ `elevator` - Lines 187-188
- ✅ `maintenanceCharge` - Line 151
- ✅ `waterCharge` - Line 163
- ✅ `energyClass` - Line 308
- ✅ `heatingSystem` - Line 310

### **Newly Fixed:**
- ✅ `siteOwnershipType` / `lotOwnership` - Line 315
- ✅ `availableFrom` / `release` / `freeOnText` - Line 324
- ✅ `completeYear` / `yearBuilt` - Lines 328-334

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS

### **When API is Back Online:**

1. **Run Validation:**
   ```bash
   npm run data-quality:blueprint
   ```

2. **Expected Output:**
   ```
   Overall Average: 85-95%+
   Properties at 100%: 4-6
   ```

3. **If Still Low:**
   - Check which fields are still missing
   - Look at Linear API response for those fields
   - Update mapper with correct field names
   - Repeat until 100%

### **If Fields Are Truly Missing:**

If validation still shows missing data after mapper fixes, then:
1. Those fields genuinely don't exist in Linear
2. Use the `LINEAR-ADMIN-REQUEST.md` checklist
3. Fill in missing data manually in Linear admin
4. Re-run validation

---

## 🔍 DEBUGGING

If you need to check what fields are being extracted:

1. **Add logging to mapper:**
   ```typescript
   console.log('Extracted fields:', {
     lotOwnership: (src as any).lotOwnership,
     siteOwnershipType: (src as any).siteOwnershipType,
     availableFrom: (src as any).availableFrom,
     release: (src as any).release,
     completeYear: nv.completeYear
   });
   ```

2. **Run dev server and check console:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Navigate to a property page and check browser console**

---

## 📊 FIELD MAPPING REFERENCE

### **From Linear API Response (`listing-api.json`):**

```json
{
  "lotOwnership": { "fi": { "value": "Oma" } },           // ✅ Now extracted
  "release": { "fi": { "value": "Heti" } },               // ✅ Now extracted
  "completeYear": { "fi": { "value": 2000 } },            // ✅ Now extracted
  "fundingCharge": { "fi": { "value": "100 € / kk" } },   // ✅ Already working
  "housingCooperativeMortgage": { "fi": { "value": null } }, // ✅ Already working
  "housingTenure": { "fi": { "value": null } },           // ✅ Already working (null is OK)
  "zoningStatus": { "fi": { "value": "Asemakaava" } },    // ✅ Already working
  "hasBalcony": { "fi": { "value": "Kyllä" } },           // ✅ Already working
  "sauna": { "fi": { "value": "Kyllä" } },                // ✅ Already working
  "housingCooperativeElevator": { "fi": { "value": "Kyllä" } } // ✅ Already working
}
```

---

## ✅ CONFIDENCE LEVEL

**High confidence** that these mapper fixes will significantly improve data quality scores because:

1. ✅ User confirmed all data exists in Linear
2. ✅ We found the exact field name mismatches
3. ✅ Fixes target the most commonly missing fields
4. ✅ Logic is sound (fallback chain for alternative field names)

---

## 🎉 EXPECTED OUTCOME

**Before:**
```
49.3% average
8/8 properties need attention
59 fields marked as "auto-fixable"
```

**After:**
```
85-95%+ average (estimated)
2-4 properties need attention (estimated)
0-10 fields genuinely missing (estimated)
```

**Best Case:**
```
100% average
0 properties need attention
All data perfectly extracted!
```

---

**STATUS:** Fixes applied, waiting for API to recover for testing.  
**NEXT:** Run `npm run data-quality:blueprint` when API is back online.
